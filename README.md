Pinata app lets a user build their own custom news feed using many external APIâ€™s. This was my first team project using AngularJS on the client side and Node.js, Express server side. We chose to use the functional CSS framework Tachyons to style the UI. I was responsible for the client side focusing on the UI. I created strong wireframes using Sketch. This was a great opportunity to pair program and get used to GitHub workflow in a team environment.
